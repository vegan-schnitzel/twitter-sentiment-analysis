# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this university project, a random forest classifier is trained and later predicts the sentiment of US tweets. Ultimately, it is investigated whether predictions improve if tweet location is added as a feature. Further information can be found in the `project-proposal` and `final-report`. 

The `env_machinelearning.yml` file defines which python libraries have been used in this analysis. With the help of this file the environment can be cloned in conda. Please note that Twitter policy forbids to upload unfiltered tweet data.
