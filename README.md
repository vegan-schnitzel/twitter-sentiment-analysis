# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this university project, a random forest classifier is trained on
and later predicts the sentiment of tweets from the US.
Ultimately, it is investigated whether prediction improves
if the location of the tweet is added as a feature.
Further information can be found in the [project proposal](project-proposal.pdf)
and [final report](final-report.pdf). 

The [environment yml](env_machinelearning.yml) file defines which python libraries
have been used in this analysis. With the help of this file, the conda environment can be
cloned. Please note that Twitter policy forbids to upload unfiltered tweet data.

**Edit 03/2023**: In the future, Twitter is (probably) only granting paying users
access to their API, so fun projects like this one aren't going to be possible anymore
for broke students like me.
