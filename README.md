# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this university project, a random forest classifier is trained and later predicts the sentiment of tweets from the US. Ultimately, it is investigated whether predictions improve if tweet location is added as a feature.

The `env_machinelearning.yml` file defines which python libraries have been used in this analysis. It can be used to clone the environment in conda. Please note that Twitter policy forbids to upload unfiltered datasets.
